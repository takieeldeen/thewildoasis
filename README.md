    - The check-ins check-outs states of all the guests.
    - The current billing of each guest by calculating their resedential costs.

    - The hotel overall state by displaying statistics for showing a comprehensive state for the hotel on the past (7-30-90) days.

## A pizza restaurant management App made by React

The Project was built using React cutting edge technology like React Router for achiving the SPA concept, tanstack query form managing the remote global states, which were a lot in this project :), and supabase for creating and managing the project database. Here are some points that were focused on in this project.

    -   Working with tanstack query to manage remote states coming from the API and making maximum use of the cache to provide the smoothest user experience possible
    -   Using React hook form which comes out of the box with tanstack query, to manage the forms in this project, and making an enhanced system for form errors handling.
    -   Working with a new tech like supabase to perform different kinds of backend services like creating RESTful API and relational database that is ready to work with no time.
    -   Practicing security concepts like authorization, authentication, JWT tech and protected routes and the ways of implementing them on the front-end side.
    -   Practicing modern and amazing concepts of reusability like The Compound component pattern which was used in this project in this like "Modals" and "Menus".
    -   Practicing methods of displaying interesting stats using Rechart library.
    -   Finally using new "and kind of easier :)" approach to style the components which is Styled components library.
